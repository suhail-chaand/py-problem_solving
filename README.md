11. The Farm Problem
    In this challenge, a farmer is asking you to tell him how many legs can be counted among all his animals. The farmer breeds three species:
    - chickens = 2 legs
    - cows = 4 legs

Following are the criteria for checking the password:
At least 1 letter between [a-z]
At least 1 number between [0-9]
At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
At least 1 character from [$#@]
Minimum length of transaction password: 7
No space accepted
Maximum length of transaction password: 12 Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma. Example If the following passwords are given as input to the program: ABd1234@1, Then, the output of the program should be: ABd1234@1
